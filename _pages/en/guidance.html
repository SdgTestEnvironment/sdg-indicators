<h3>Open-Source-Project on GitHub</h3>

The national reporting platform - SDG is a publicly available tool serving the dissemination and presentation of data for
Germany on  the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda by the United Nations (UN).
<br><br>
In order to conform with the UNâ€™s Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics, the minimum characteristics an SDG NRP should have are that it should:
<br><br>
- be managed by national statistical offices;
- features official statistics and metadata according to established standard methodology;
- be publicly accessible;
- allows for feedback from data users;
- features open source (free) technology.
<br><br>
In addition, the German SDG-NRP has been developed in accordance with recognized international guidelines, especially with regard to open data and software.

<h3>Sources</h3>

The Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) actively supports the development of national reporting platforms, in particular as an open source
solution for the presentation of SDG indicators. Precursors in this field are the USA and Great Britain.
The current version of the German reporting platform has been developed based on an earlier version of the UK NRP, and adapted to the needs of German statistics.
The project code is publicly available in a <a href="https://github.com/G205SDGs/sdg-indicators" taret="_blank" onclick="return confirm_alert('GitHub', 'En');">Github repository</a>.
<br><br>
The new universal version of the open-SDG platform developed by the US, UK and Center for Open Data Enterprise is available.
We encourage you to familiarize yourself with the national US and UK platforms for SDGs and the
