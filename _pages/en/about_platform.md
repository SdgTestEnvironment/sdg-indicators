The online platform comprises two components, namely the German set of indicators for the global sustainability goals ([Sustainable Development Goals, SDGs](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/)) of the United Nations 2030 Agenda and the indicator set of the [German Sustainable Development Strategy](https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-en/issues/sustainability/) (Deutsche Nachhaltigkeitsstrategie, DNS). Since the German Sustainable Development Strategy is aimed at implementing the 2030 Agenda at the national level, indicators shared by both strategies are linked to each other on the platform.

The time series of the indicators of both online platforms are available for download.

A direct link to the homepage of the DNS online platform can be found at the top right of this page next to the search field: [<img src="https://g205sdgs.github.io/sdg-indicators/assets/img/about/DNS Wheel.png" alt="Wheel">](https://sustainabledevelopment-deutschland.github.io/en)

Both sets of indicators are structured according to the 17 goals of the United Nations 2030 Agenda. Accordingly, the icons and the colours chosen for the 17 goals (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2) which are used here and on the DNS online platform correspond to those of the United Nations. The icons are protected by copyright.

## Aim and background

The aim of the SDG online platform is to present the indicators of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals for Germany.

The SDGs are anchored in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which was adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations in September 2015 and thus agreed by all Member States. The Agenda has provided the basis for shaping global economic progress in accordance with social justice and within the ecological limits of the earth.

The Federal Statistical Office is responsible for coordinating and publishing national SDG indicator data for Germany. The SDG online platform enables the competent international organisations (custodian agencies) to directly download the data for individual SDG indicators and use them, for example, for global reporting assignments given to them by the United Nations (Fig. 3). It also provides constantly updated information on the status of the German SDG indicators and detailed information on the methodology used for calculating these indicators.

In some cases the data for Germany include minor methodological deviations from the specifications of the competent custodian agencies. In other cases only time series are available which are affected by larger deviations from the globally defined calculation methodology (for more information, see “About us“ and [Navigation](https://sustainabledevelopment-germany.github.io/en/about_navigation) in the section on global metadata). This may lead to the respective custodian agencies adjusting the data provided to ensure international comparability. Therefore, the time series found in the [Global SDG Indicators Database](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/) may differ from the time series provided here.


## Possible amendments until 2030

The existing set of indicators is undergoing two major revisions in 2020 (already completed) and 2025. The [IAEG-SDGs](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/iaeg-sdgs) (Inter-Agency and Expert Group on Sustainable Development Goal Indicators) has been commissioned to coordinate these revisions. During the revisions, new indicators may be added to the set, and existing indicators may be replaced or removed. The changes will be incorporated as quickly as possible on the SDG online platform.

## Comparison of SDG and DNS indicators

The United Nations SDG indicators and their numbering are not identical to the DNS indicators. If an SDG indicator is comparable to a DNS indicator, this is indicated by a button with a direct link to the respective indicator (Fig. 4).

## Technical background

To present the data for each participating country in a formatted form, the open source project Open SDG offers a standardised template of an online platform on GitHub. More information can be found here: [Technical instructions](https://sustainabledevelopment-germany.github.io/en/about_guidance/).
