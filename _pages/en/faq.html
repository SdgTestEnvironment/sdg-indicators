<h3 class="h3bold">1. How often is the data updated?</h3>
The frequency with which new data is published and the time at which this happens varies for many indicators.
As soon as new data is available for an indicator or previously published data is corrected, this data is also
published on this online platform. The platform is usually updated once a month. You can see when the last update
took place on the start page next to the button for downloading the data.

<h3 class="h3bold">2. How are data gaps closed?</h3>
If no data is available for an indicator, possible data sources are sought and checked for quality. If the
quality meets our requirements, the data is included in the SDG online platform.

<h3 class="h3bold">3. How can I suggest new or different data sources?</h3>
For feedback on the data sources we use or for suggestions for new data sources, please contact us
here: <a href="mailto:{{site.email_contacts.questions}}">{{site.email_contacts.questions}}</a>

<h3 class="h3bold">4. What does the report status mean?</h3>
e have used four different types of reporting status for an indicator, which are also colour coded:
<br><br>
* Green: Reported – The most important national data for this indicator or further information is available on this website.
The data may not yet be available for all desired disaggregations.<br>
* Orange: In progress - One or more possible data source(s) has/have already been identified. The corresponding data series
are currently being prepared for provision on this platform.<br>
* Red: Not available - No data is available for this indicator.<br>
* Grey: Not applicable - This internationally relevant indicator cannot be meaningfully calculated for Germany or can only be answered in a global context.

<h3 class="h3bold">5. Why are some indicators labelled as "available" without actual data being stored?</h3>
Some indicators cannot be meaningfully populated with data at national level, e.g. indicator 5.c.1 "Proportion of countries with systems to track and make
public allocations for gender equality and women’s empowerment". Instead of only showing the value 1 or 0 in such cases, further information on the
context of the indicator is presented.

<h3 class="h3bold">6. What do the characters and letters on the data in the graphs and tables mean?</h3>
If individual data points need to be labelled in any way, this is done using one of the symbols below.
A distinction is made between so-called value-explaining characters (characters next to numbers, e.g. p, r, or s)
and value-setting characters (characters instead of numbers, e.g. X or /).
The value-explaining characters appear when you move the mouse over the corresponding data point in the chart and are
attached to the numerical values in the table view. The value-setting characters only appear in the table view.
The meanings of the symbols are displayed in the area
below the graph and table.<br><br>
The possible labels and their meanings are:<br>
0 = less than half of 1 in the last digit occupied, but more than zero<br>
‒ = no figures or magnitude zero<br>
... = data will be available later<br>
/ = no data because the numerical value is not sufficiently reliable<br>
. = numerical value unknown or not be disclosed<br>
X = cell blocked for logical reasons<br>
( ) = limited informational value because numerical value is of limited statistical reliability<br>
| = fundamental change within a series affecting comparisons over time<br>
p = provisional data<br>
r = revised data<br>
s = estimated data

<h3 class="h3bold">7. Why does some of the data presented on the online platform not correspond to the SDG indicators?</h3>
For some of the SDG indicators, it is not possible to find data that corresponds exactly to the requirements of the indicator. In these cases, where
possible, data is presented that reflects the subject area of the indicator and thus still provides relevant information,
even if it differs in wording from the actual SDG indicator.

<h3 class="h3bold">8. What is disaggregation?</h3>
Disaggregation is used to divide an existing indicator into further subcategories for more detailed analysis.
The best known are age or gender. For many indicators, however, separate disaggregations apply, which are defined
in the indicator name or by the international organisation responsible for the indicator.

<h3 class="h3bold">9. Why can there be differences between the data for Germany on this platform and in the UN database?</h3>
National official statistics are the data source for most of the indicators in the global UN database.
For some indicators, however, the respective international organisations also compile estimated data or
recalculate the data provided by the individual countries in order to ensure international comparability.
They use their own methodology for this purpose. If the global database contains recalculated data from the international
organisations, there may be differences between this data and the data on this platform.

<h3 class="h3bold">10. Can other countries copy this website?</h3>
The website can be used freely to create your own online platform. The terms and conditions for the use of GitHub apply.
