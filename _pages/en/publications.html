    <p style="padding-bottom: 70px;">Many national and international actors were involved in the development process of the indicator framework of
      the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals; their good and intensive cooperation led to an agreement in a very short time.
      The framework itself is intended to take into account as many aspects of the United Nations 2030 Agenda as possible; as a result,
      it is very comprehensive with its 231 indicators. Official statistics are now faced with the task of filling the multifaceted
      indicators with life. The Federal Statistical Office already published the first national figures in July 2016 and will continue
      to actively participate in the further development process of the framework. This opens up the opportunity for the Federal Statistical
      Office to tap new data sources and expand the field of vision of official statistics in terms of content.
