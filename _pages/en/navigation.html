<h3>Structure of the SDG online platform</h3>
The online platform is structured into the indicator set of the
<a href="https://www.bundesregierung.de/resource/blob/975274/1941044/2e8480a6b93910b347e647814ff59a7f/2021-07-09-kurzpapier-n-englisch-data.pdf?download=1" target="_blank" onclick="return confirm_alert('the Federal Government', 'En');"">German Sustainable Development Strategy (DNS)</a>
and the indicator set for Germany on the global
<a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/" target="_blank" onclick="return confirm_alert('the UN', 'En');">Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</a>
of the United Nations 2030 Agenda. The German Sustainable Development Strategy is the national implementation of the 2030 Agenda,
which is why related indicators from both strategies are linked to each other on the platform. You can find a direct link to the
homepage of the SDG online platform under "Start".
<br><br>
The SDG online platform is divided into 17 goals, 169 targets and the corresponding indicators (248 - however, thirteen indicators
repeat under two or three different targets).

<h3>Presentation of the indicators</h3>
The relevant data for each indicator is presented in a chart and a table. This presentation is supplemented for some indicators by
an interactive map showing the data for the German federal states. However, some indicators cannot be meaningfully depicted simply
by presenting data. Where possible, explanatory texts with links to thematically relevant information on the indicators are shown
here.<br>The green buttons underneath the chart can be used to download the data in
CSV format or the chart as a PNG file.

<h3>National and Global Metadata and data sources</h3>
The "National Metadata", "Global Metadata" and "Data sources" tabs can be found at the bottom of the indicator pages.<br><br>The
"National Metadata" tab contains an assessment of whether or not the time series shown fulfil the requirements for the indicator
from the "Global Metadata" of the Custodian Agency. Under "National Metadata" you will also find a PDF document for each
indicator containing detailed information on the data shown.<br><br>The most important information on the respective indicators
is summarised under the "Global Metadata" tab and a link to the metadata is provided. The requirements for the indicator are
described there by the responsible international organisations.<br><br>Under "Data sources" you will
find links to the organisation or organisations that provided the data for the time series and - where possible - links directly to
the specific data sources.

<h3>Comparison of DNS and SDG indicators</h3>
There are numerous thematic overlaps between the indicators of the German Sustainable Development Strategy and the indicators of the
UN Sustainable Development Goals.<br><br>Some of the SDG indicators are similar or congruent with the indicators of the German
Sustainable Development Strategy. Both sets of indicators are structured according to the 17 goals of the UN 2030 Agenda. However,
there are differences in the numbering and labelling of the indicators. If a DNS indicator is comparable with an SDG indicator, this
is indicated by a button with a direct link to the respective indicator.
