The Federal Statistical Office is responsible for coordinating and publishing national data
for Germany on the indicators of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
and for statistical reporting on Germany's progress in this area.
<br><br>
In July 2019, the Federal Statistical Office launched the
<a href="https://sdg-indikatoren.de/">online platform</a> for the SDG indicators. This online
platform displays all indicators for Germany on global sustainable development in an edited 
and interactive form. Further information, thematically related time series and (if relevant)
a more detailed presentation by characteristics such as age or gender round off the data available.
The online platform enables the responsible international organisations (custodian agencies) to
download the data for their SDG indicators for Germany directly and use it for global reporting, for example.
