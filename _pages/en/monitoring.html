The UN General Assembly adopted the
<a href="https://undocs.org/A/RES/70/1" target="_blanc" onclick="return confirm_alert('the UN', 'En');">2030 Agenda</a>
for Sustainable Development in September 2015. The aim of the Agenda, which is based on the Millennium Development Goals,
is to transform the world for the better until 2030. The 2030 Agenda has an unprecedented range and importance as it
applies on a global scale and everyone is called upon to contribute. The pledge is to leave no one behind during this journey.
Therefore, the focus is on those who have the longest way to go. Appropriate indicators are to be used to measure
progress towards achieving the total 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda and the 169 targets included.
An international working group, namely the
<a href="https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/iaeg-sdgs/" target="_blanc" onclick="return confirm_alert('the UN Statistical Commission', 'En');">Inter-Agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators</a>
(IAEG-SDG) has been tasked with the development of a set of 231 indicators.
The Federal Statistical Office was a member of this group from mid-2015 to may 2021.
<br><br>
The IAEG-SDG is also responsible for reviewing and further developing the set of indicators.
Annual fine-tuning and two rounds of larger revisions in 2020 and 2025 have been scheduled.
The <a href="https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/iaeg-sdgs/2020-comp-rev/" target="_blanc" onclick="return confirm_alert('the UN Statistical Commission', 'En');">2020 revision</a>
has been completed. Among other things, six indicators were deleted, eight new indicators included and 14
indicators replaced in the set. The 2030 Agenda requires a disaggregation of the individual indicators by dimensions such as
sex, age, income, migration status, disability, geographic location, and further dimensions. The IAEG-SDG is working on
facilitating the provision of all these data and, additionally, making them globally comparable.
<br><br>
Since July 2019, data for Germany and explanatory indicator information have been provided in a
processed form and an interactive environment on this online platform on indicators of the UN Sustainable Development Goals.
