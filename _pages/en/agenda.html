The <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/development-agenda/" target="_blank" onclick="return confirm_alert('the United Nations', 'En');">2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development</a>
is a global United Nations action plan for the planet, people and their prosperity adopted by the UN General Assembly in
September 2015. The 2030 Agenda, developed by the Member States of the United Nations, is a roadmap for
“Transforming our world for the better“, aimed at achieiving a sustainable transformation in social, economic and environmental
terms by 2030. It comprises 17 global goals that are subdivided into 169 targets with over 240 indicators.
The goals are called Sustainable Development Goals and are abbreviated as SDGs (Fig. 1).

<h3>Monitoring goal achievement</h3>

The United Nations Statistical Commission was mandated to develop global indicators for the targets together with the national
statistical offices. The Inter-aSgency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators
(<a href="https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/iaeg-sdgs/2020-comprev/UNSC-proposal/"target="_blank" onclick="return confirm_alert('the United Nations Statistics Division', 'En');">IAEG-SDGs</a>)
established for this purpose presented a set of indicators and has continuously refined it. The IAEG-SDGs is composed of
statistical offices of some Member States of the United Nations, including the Federal Statistical Office representing Germany.


<h3>National reporting on sustainable development in Germany</h3>

The Federal Statistical Office is responsible for coordinating and publishing national SGD indicator data for Germany and for
statistical reporting on Germany's progress in this field.
<br><br>
In July 2019, the Federal Statistical Office launched this online platform on the indicators of the UN global Sustainable
Development Goals. Here time series and associated metadata regarding global sustainable development are provided in a
processed and interactive form for Germany. The SDGs section of the online platform enables the competent international
organisations (custodian agencies) to directly download Germany’s SDG indicator data and use them, for example, for global
reporting assignments.
