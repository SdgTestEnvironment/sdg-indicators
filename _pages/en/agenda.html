<h3 class="h3bold">United Nations Sustainable Development Goals</h3>
On 25 September 2015, the heads of state and government of the 193 member states of the United Nations adopted
the <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/development-agenda/" target="_blank" onclick="return confirm_alert('United Nations', 'En');">2030 Agenda</a>
entitled "Transforming our world" in New York. The strategy is based on the concept of sustainable
development defined in the 1987 Brundtland report. This is defined as development "that meets the
needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs."
<br><br>
Unlike the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the 2030 Agenda applies equally to industrialised,
emerging and developing countries. It focuses on more equal opportunities and intergenerational justice,
sustainable economic growth and the sustainable management of natural resources. The goals set are to
be achieved by 2030. The agenda explicitly calls for the world's weakest and most vulnerable to take
centre stage and to leave no one behind on the path to transformation.
<br><br>
The preamble to the 2030 Agenda names five core messages that precede the 17 Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) as guiding principles for action: People, Planet, Prosperity, Peace and Partnership
(the so-called "5 Ps"). For the 17 sustainability goals, 169 targets were defined and a framework
with 231 indicators was developed against which the goals are to be measured.

<h3 class="h3bold">Monitoring the achievement of goals</h3>
The United Nations Statistical Commission was commissioned to develop global indicators for the
targets together with the national statistical offices. The
<a href="https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/iaeg-sdgs/2020-comprev/UNSC-proposal/" target="_blank" onclick="return confirm_alert('United Nations', 'En');">Inter-agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs)</a>,
which was set up for this purpose and is made up of statistical offices of some United Nations member
states, has presented a set of indicators. The German Federal Statistical
Office was a member of the IAEG-SDGs from mid-2015 to May 2021. The IAEG-SDGs is also tasked with
revising and continuously developing the indicator set. Annual refinements (refinements) and two
global revision processes (comprehensive reviews) are planned for 2020 and 2025.
The <a href="https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/iaeg-sdgs/2020-comp-rev/" target="_blank" onclick="return confirm_alert('United Nations', 'En');">2020 revision</a>
has been completed.
