Although the information on this website is produced with the greatest care, we cannot accept any liability with regard to its being correct, complete and up to date. In particular,

In addition to information of its own, the Federal Statistical Office provides links to external websites offering information of other providers. Neither is such external information
provided by the Federal Statistical Office, nor is the Federal Statistical Office in a position to exert influence on the information offered on third-party pages. The information
offered on external pages to which the Federal Statistical Office provides links does not reflect the opinion of the Federal Statistical Office; such links only serve the purpose of
providing additional information and illustrating connections. The Federal Statistical Office is not liable for external information to which the Office just offers links as described
above. Responsibility lies only with the provider of such information. If, due to technical or organisational problems, users should not be able to utilise the website, they shall not
have any claim whatsoever against the Federal Statistical Office.

<h3 class="h3bold">General copyright</h3>
The following applies to all standard publications of the Federal Statistical Office, either in printed or electronic form, and for the content of this website, including charts and
downloadable products, unless additional or other information is given on the product/web page itself.
<br><br>
© Statistisches Bundesamt (Destatis), 2023 <br>
Reproduction and distribution, also of parts, are permitted provided that the source is mentioned.
<br><br>
This applies to any redistribution of texts, data and charts by third parties where the Federal Statistical Office is the copyright owner and holds exclusive publishing rights.
Re-use is permitted both for commercial and non-commercial purposes. There are also no restrictions on distribution by electronic means, via the internet or in printed form.
No express authorisation is required from the Federal Statistical Office. It is, however, required to provide a source note. Statistisches Bundesamt (Destatis) shall be named as the
publisher in the list of references.
<br><br>
Amendments, deletions/abridgements or omissions, redesigns or other modifications shall be identified as such, or a note shall be included in the references stating that the data have
been changed, have only been used as the basis for calculation or have been presented in a different form.
<br><br>
Excluded from the temporally and geographically unlimited scope of use are the usage rights of third parties which are explicitly set out in our publications or on our web pages
(e.g. photo rights). This also applies to jointly-issued products. There is no general policy here. Each product must be assessed on a case-by-case basis.
<br><br>
It is therefore recommended that, when exploiting our data, users ensure that the copyright information is included in the product in question and, if necessary, that they contact the
copyright owners given in the Legal Notice.
